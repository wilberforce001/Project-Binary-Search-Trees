Purpose of Binary Search Trees (BSTs):
Binary Search Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science used to store and manage sorted data efficiently. The key property of a binary search tree is that, for each node:

The values of all nodes in the left subtree are less than the value of the node.
The values of all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the value of the node.
BSTs enable fast search, insertion, and deletion operations, making them ideal for scenarios where quick access to sorted data is required.

Understanding the Code:
Node Class:
javascript
Copy code
class Node {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data =  data;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}
This class represents a node in the binary search tree. Each node has some data, a reference to its left child, and a reference to its right child.
Tree Class:
javascript
Copy code
class Tree {
    constructor(array) {
        this.root = this.buildTree(array);
    }
}

The Tree class represents the Binary Search Tree. It has a root property, which points to the root node of the tree. The constructor takes an array of data as input and constructs the tree from it.
Building the Tree:
javascript
Copy code
buildTree(array) { ... }
The buildTree method constructs a balanced binary search tree from a sorted array of data. It uses a helper function to recursively divide the array into two halves and create nodes.
Balancing the Tree:
javascript
Copy code
rebalance() { ... }
The rebalance method rebalances an unbalanced binary search tree. It first stores all nodes in the tree using an in-order traversal, then rebuilds the tree from the sorted array of nodes, ensuring it becomes balanced.
Tree Traversal Methods:
javascript
Copy code
levelOrder(callback) { ... }
preOrder(callback) { ... }
inOrder(callback) { ... }
postOrder(callback) { ... }
These methods perform different types of tree traversals: level-order, pre-order, in-order, and post-order. They allow you to visit all nodes in the tree in a specific order and perform a callback operation on each node.
Checking Balance:
javascript
Copy code
isBalanced(node = this.root) { ... }
checkHeight(node) { ... }
These methods check if the binary search tree is balanced. They calculate the height of each subtree recursively and compare the heights to determine balance.
Driver Script:
The driver script generates random numbers, creates an initial binary search tree (bst), checks if it's balanced, and performs various traversals on it.
Then, it creates an unbalanced binary search tree (unbalancedBst), rebalances it, and performs the same operations as before to demonstrate the rebalancing process.
Applications of Binary Search Trees:
Binary Search Trees are commonly used in:

Database systems for indexing and searching data.
Symbol tables in compilers and interpreters.
Implementing binary search algorithms.
File systems for organizing file directories.
Implementing various data structures like priority queues, sets, and maps.
In summary, Binary Search Trees are versatile data structures with various applications in computer science, particularly where efficient management and retrieval of sorted data are required.
